Oh God have mercy on me with the Quran and make it for me an imam, light, guidance and mercy ۞

Oh God remind me of him what I forgot and teach me from him what I did not know and grant me his recitation at night and the edges of the day and make it my excuse Oh God of the worlds ۞

Oh God, fix for me my religion, which is my infallibility, and fix for me my world, which contains my pension, and fix for me my hereafter, which contains my hostility, and make life an increase for me in all good, and make death a rest for me from all evil ۞

Oh God make the best of my life the end of it and the best of my work its ends and the best of my days the day I meet you ۞

Oh God, I ask you to live a good life and die together and a return that is not shameful or revealing ۞

Oh God, I ask you the best of the matter, the best of supplication, the best of success, the best of knowledge, the best of work, the best of reward, the best of life, the best of death, the steadfastness of me, the weight of my scales, the achievement of my faith, raise my degree, accept my prayers, forgive my sins, and ask you the highest from Paradise ۞

O God, I ask You for Your mercy, the intentions of Your forgiveness, safety from all iniquity, booty from all righteousness, winning Paradise and deliverance from Hell.۞

Oh God, improve our punishment in all things and protect us from the shame of this world and the torture of the hereafter ۞

Oh God, divide for us from your fear what you prevent between us and your disobedience, and from your obedience what your paradise will inform us of, and from certainty what the calamities of the world will be easy for us, and our enjoyment of our hearing, our sights, and our strength, what revives us, and make him our inheritor and make our revenge on those who wronged us, and make us victorious over our enemies, and do not make our disaster in our religion, and do not make the world our biggest concern, nor the amount of our knowledge, nor You dominate us who do not have mercy on us ۞

O God, do not leave us a sin except his forgiveness, and they are nothing but his relief, and no religion except his cause, and none of the needs of this world and the hereafter except its cause, O Most Merciful of the Merciful ۞

Our Lord has brought us good in this world and in the hereafter is good and saved us from the torment of fire, and may Allah's prayers be upon our master and prophet Muhammad and his family and good companions.
